```

## Guide to files ##
There are three different directory files
- directory.rb: This file is the principal directory program
- directory_copy.rb: This file was cloned from the original halfway through the project and I used it to experiment with some other feautres but the added features were not useful. Kept file for legacy purposes.
- directory_additions.rb - this file has some more advanced feautres added onto the final version of directory.rb. It is the most advanced program.
